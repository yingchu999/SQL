This includes three columns: ad_id, user_id, action.
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains a ad id, an id of user, and a action taken by this user regarding this ad.
The action column is a ENUM type of ('clicked', 'reviewed', 'ignore').
Performance of each ad is measured using clicked_through_rate (ctr), where ctr = total clicked numbers / (total clicked numbers + total reviewed numbers).
Write a query to find the ctr of each ad.

select ad_id, ifnull(round(avg(case when action = 'clicked' then 1 
                               when action = 'viewed' then 0 
                               else null end)*100,2),0) as ctr
from ads
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc,ad_id;
