Approach 1:

SELECT
        max(CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN name END )AS America,
        max(CASE WHEN continent = 'Asia' THEN name END )AS Asia,
        max(CASE WHEN continent = 'Europe' THEN name END )AS Europe  
FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS row_id FROM student) AS t
GROUP BY row_id;


Approach 2:

SELECT MAX(America) AS America, MAX(Asia) as Asia, MAX(Europe) AS Europe
FROM (
	SELECT 
        CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN @r1 := @r1 + 1
             WHEN continent = 'Asia'    THEN @r2 := @r2 + 1
             WHEN continent = 'Europe'  THEN @r3 := @r3 + 1 END row_id,
        CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN name END America,
        CASE WHEN continent = 'Asia'    THEN name END Asia,
        CASE WHEN continent = 'Europe'  THEN name END Europe
    FROM student, (SELECT @r1 := 0, @r2 := 0, @r3 := 0) tmp
    ORDER BY name) t
GROUP BY row_id;
