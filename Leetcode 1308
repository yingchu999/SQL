Solution1:
select s1.gender, s1.day, sum(s2.score_points) as total
from scores s1, scores s2
where s1.gender = s2.gender and s1.day >= s2.day
group by s1.player_name, s1.day
order by s1.gender, s1.day;

Solution2:
SELECT gender, day, 
       SUM(score_points) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY day) AS total
FROM Scores;
