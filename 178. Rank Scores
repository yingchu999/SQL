# Approach 1:
SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(distinct Score) FROM Scores WHERE Score >= s.Score) Rank
FROM Scores s
ORDER BY Score desc

# Approach 2:

select score, dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as 'Rank'
from scores;

# Approach 3:

SELECT
  Score,
  @rank := @rank + (@prev <> (@prev := Score)) Rank
FROM
  Scores,
  (SELECT @rank := 0, @prev := -1) init
ORDER BY Score desc
