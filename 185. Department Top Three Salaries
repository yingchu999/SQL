# Approach 1: Using dense_rank

with a as 
(
select 
  *, dense_rank() over (partition by departmentid order by salary desc) as r
from employee
)

select 
  d.name as department, a.name as employee, a.salary
from 
  a 
    join 
  department d on a.departmentid = d.id
where 
  r <= 3;


# Approach 2: Using sub_query

SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        )
;
