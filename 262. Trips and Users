# My approach:

with a as
(select t.client_id, t.driver_id, t.status, t.request_at
from trips t
join users u1
join users u2
on t.client_id = u1.users_id and t.driver_id = u2.users_id
where u1.banned = 'No' and u2.banned = 'No' and (t.request_at between'2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'))

select b.request_at as day, ifnull(round(c.cnt/b.cnt,2),0) as 'cancellation rate'
from
(select request_at, count(*) as cnt
from a 
group by request_at) b
left join
(select request_at, count(*) as cnt
from a 
where status <> 'completed'
group by request_at) c
on b.request_at = c.request_at;

# Better approach:

select t.Request_at Day,
       ROUND((count(IF(t.status!='completed',TRUE,null))/count(*)),2) as 'Cancellation Rate'
from Trips t where 
t.Client_Id in (Select Users_Id from Users where Banned='No') 
and t.Driver_Id in (Select Users_Id from Users where Banned='No')
and t.Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by t.Request_at;
