# Approach 1: Using join

select 
    e1.name as employee
from 
    employee e1
        join 
    employee e2
on e1.managerid = e2.id
where e1.salary > e2.salary;

# Approach 2: Without join

SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
